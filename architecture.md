# Circadian Rhythm App â€” Architecture

## 1. High-Level Overview

The application is a sophisticated native desktop app for macOS built with Tauri and React. It provides comprehensive circadian and ultradian rhythm tracking with real-time visualization and precise timing features.

**Major Update**: The app now integrates real HealthKit data to provide personalized circadian rhythm analysis based on actual physiological patterns rather than generic assumptions.

*   **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, built using Vite. Features a component-based architecture with specialized rhythm tracking components.
*   **Styling**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a modern, utility-first approach with dynamic color theming.
*   **Backend & Packaging**: [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) wraps the web frontend into a lightweight, secure, and native macOS application. All application logic is currently client-side.
*   **Real-time Features**: Advanced timing systems with second-level precision for both circadian (24-hour) and ultradian (90-minute) rhythm tracking.

## 2. File & Folder Structure

The project features a modular component-based architecture optimized for rhythm tracking.

1.  **Real-time Clock**: Multiple `useEffect` hooks poll system time every second for precise timing
2.  **Dual Rhythm Tracking**: 
    - Circadian phases (24-hour daily cycles)
    - Ultradian cycles (90-minute energy cycles)
3.  **Dynamic Calculations**: Real-time computation of:
    - Current phase positions and progress
    - Energy intensity percentages
    - Countdown timers with second precision
